# LANforge Python Script Examples

Reference Python scripts which exercise basic components of LANforge HTTP API automation capabilities.

Currently, these examples exercise direct HTTP API invocation. While we support this approach,
other methods with less boilerplate may be more suitable, for example the LANforge HTTP API Python
wrappers available [here](../../lanforge_client/).

Please reach out to [`support@candelatech.com`](mailto:support@candelatech.com) should you have any questions.
