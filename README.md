# LANforge Perl, Python, and Shell Scripts

**This repository contains a collection of scripts and Python and Perl-based scripting libraries designed to automate LANforge systems.**

Please contact [`support@candelatech.com`](mailto:support@candelatech.com) if you have any questions or encounter issues.

## Overview

These scripts span a variety of use cases, including automating Chamber View tests, configuring LANforge ports and traffic pairs, and much more.

**No additional setup is required to run these scripts on a system with LANforge pre-installed**. On your LANforge system, you can find this repository in the `/home/lanforge/scripts/` directory. (e.g. CT523c, CT521b). The contents of the directory match the version of LANforge installed on your system (see the [tagged releases](https://github.com/greearb/lanforge-scripts/tags) to clone specific version.)

To setup and use these scripts on a system without LANforge pre-installed or to use a specific version (e.g. specific LANforge release), please follow the instructions outlined in the [LANforge Python Scripts README](./py-scripts/README.md).

For more advanced users wanting to develop their own automation, we offer the following:

- Auto-generated Python library in [`lanforge_client/`](./lanforge_client/)
  - **NOTE: This library is under development and subject to change as it progresses.**
  - Designed to make LANforge CLI commands and LANforge JSON API endpoints available in Python.
  - See the [`README`](./lanforge_client/README.md) for more details.
- Perl modules in [`LANforge/`](./LANforge/)
  - See the [`README`](./LANforge/README.md) for more details.

If you would like to contribute to LANforge scripts, please read the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) document for more information.

## Quick Tips

**NOTE:** In LANforge documentation, the term 'port' is used interchangable for network interface.

### Commonly Used Scripts

The `lf_*.pl` scripts are typically more complete and general purpose
scripts, though some are ancient and very specific.

In particular, these scripts are more modern and may be a good place to start:

| Name                 | Purpose                                                                      |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lf_associate_ap.pl` | LANforge server script for associating virtual stations to an arbitrary SSID |
| `lf_attenmod.pl`     | Query and update CT70X programmable attenuators                              |
| `lf_firemod.pl`      | Query and update connections (Layer 3)                                       |
| `lf_icemod.pl`       | Query and update WAN links and impairments                                   |
| `lf_portmod.pl`      | Query and update physical and virtual ports                                  |
| `lf_tos_test.py`     | Generate traffic at different QoS and report in spreadsheet                  |
| `lf_sniff.py`        | Create packet capture files, especially OFDMA /AX captures                   |

The `lf_wifi_rest_example.pl` script shows how one might call the other scripts from
within a script.

### Exploring LANforge JSON API/Crafting CLI Commands

When the LANforge GUI is running, a user can use the web-based LANforge Command Composer tool to generate CLI commands, either for use directly through the telnet interface (port 4001) or indirectly through the `cli-json/` LANFORGE JSON API endpoint.

To access this tool, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the Help page (either from the LANforge or remotely)

   - From the LANforge system (e.g. through VNC): [`http://localhost:8080/help`](http://localhost:8080/help)
   - Remotely:
     - Directly by IP address: `http://192.168.1.101:8080/help`
     - If your network supports DNS resolution: `http://ct523c-cafe:8080/help`

2. Click on the link for your desired command, e.g. `add_sta`

   - Each CLI command will display two links. The link _on the left side_ takes you to the Command Composer tool

3. Set the desired fields for the command

4. Click the `Parse Command` at the top
   - This generates CLI output for the fields you configured at the top of the webpage
   - Generated output includes:
     - CLI command for use in the telnet interface
     - Commands to manually send data to the `cli-json/` LANFORGE JSON API endpoint

More information on other LANforge JSON API endpoints can be by navigating to the main (root) endpoint `http://localhost:8080/` or querying it through `curl` (very verbose, e.g. `curl http://localhost:8080 | jq`).

## Python Scripts

**NOTE: LANforge Python scripts require Python 3.7+** (which is backwards compatible to Fedora 27 systems).

See the [LANforge Python Scripts README](./py-scripts/README.md) for more information, including setup for use on non-LANforge systems.

Existing offerings largely include test and helper scripts in addition to importable library code for external use and/or use in new automation.

Helper scripts, especially creation and modification scripts, are designed as tools in a toolbox. Each toolbox script performs a single task, like a tool in the toolbox. For example, the [`create_station.py`](./py-scripts/create_station.py) is designed to create and configure LANforge station ports, providing many options for that specific use case.

## Compatibility

Scripts will be kept backwards and forwards compatible with LANforge
releases as much as possible.

## Setup and Installation

Pre-installed LANforge systems generally do not require additional setup, save for specific advanced use cases. The scripts version on the system (located in `/home/lanforge/scripts/`) will match the version of LANforge software installed.

As currently implemented, scripts in this repository require the structure of this directory as present. Many scripts import from and call into each other (primarily Python), so modifying script location will likely break script assumptions. Things that may break assumptions and prevent script usage include moving the script to another directory.

### Python Scripts

See the setup steps outlined in the `py-scripts/` README [here](./py-scripts/README.md) for Python scripting setup, including configuring a specific version of LANforge scripts.

### Perl Scripts

To use LANforge Perl automation, the system which will run the scripts must have the following packages installed. On Linux systems, most of these packages are available through your system's package manager as `.deb` or `.rpm` packages.

| Package           | RPM                | Required                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Net::Telnet       | perl-Net-Telnet    | Yes                          |
| JSON              | perl-JSON          | Yes, for JSON parsing        |
| JSON::PrettyPrint | perl-JSON-PP       | No, but useful for debugging |
| Pexpect           | python3-pexpect    | Yes                          |
| XlsxWriter        | python3-xlsxwriter | Yes, for Xlsx output         |
